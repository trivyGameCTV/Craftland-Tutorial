# Item - User Manual

A firearm, a grenade, some bulletsâ€”these are all items. In the game, when it comes to equipment or tools, the concept of items is indispensable.

Items rely on the player's backpack when they are with the player. The player's backpack holds these items.

## Item Categories

Items are categorized as follows:

### Equipment

Equipment includes weapons, armor, backpacks, attachments, and functional gear.

Here, "backpack" refers to a specific item rather than the concept mentioned earlier of holding items.

### Tools

Tools include grenades, healing items, special items, and various types of bullets.

## Player Backpack

The player backpack here differs from the backpack; it refers to the abstract concept of the player's item space. A backpack can increase the space of a player's backpack and provide cosmetic changes.

Devices can be activated by scripts. Once activated, equipment appears under this category in the backpack.

#### Black Hole Space

Equipment and tools not displayed in the backpack interface exist in black hole space. Players cannot directly view these items in their backpacks.

### Using Items in the Backpack

Generally speaking, most items can be used or automatically used outside of the backpack, including weapons, attachments, grenades, etc.

However, certain operations can still be performed within the backpack.

Using specific items:

## Placing Items in Scenes

There are two ways to generate items at a designated location: generators and units.

Using a generator to spawn items can be set to refresh each round but can only specify types. If an item from a previous spawn isn't taken before refreshing, it will be replaced with newly generated items.

Using units to place items allows for precise specification of weapon or tool types generated. By default, only one corresponding item will be generated.

### Generator

![image-20240730180747977](./img/image-20240730180747977.png)

![image-20240730180753598](./img/image-20240730180753598.png)

Select a generator based on type; take weapons as an example:

![image-20240730181011764](./img/image-20240730181011764.png)

In configuration, you can choose the type of weapon generated:

![image-20240730181034487](./img/image-20240730181034487.png)

In each round's reset component, you can set whether this spawn point refreshes at each round's start.

![image-20240730181104786](./img/image-20240730181104786.png)

Notably, when choosing to generate weapons, a matching set of ammo and attachments will also be generated.

### Unit

![image-20240730175100849](./img/image-20240730175100849.png)

Using weapons and tools from units allows you to generate configured weapons or tools at specified locations.

Items placed this way can have their properties modified:
