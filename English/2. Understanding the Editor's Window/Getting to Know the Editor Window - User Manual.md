#### Debugging Tool

##### Strict Mode

In strict mode, once an error occurs in the process, debug mode will be exited. This allows for more accurate location of the problem.

##### Debug Mode

Breakpoints will only take effect in debug mode.

##### Performance

Shows how much local storage space the current UI image cache uses. You can free up space by clearing the cache, but the UI image will need to be reloaded the next time it is used.

It is recommended to clean up the cache when there are many projects opened and there is a large amount of content that will no longer be used.
