# Asset Store

*The asset store is under development and currently offers limited functionality, and interactions and layouts may be subject to modification.

The Asset Store provides some pre-made assets, which can enable you to quickly obtain some resources needed for game development. When you need to use a resource, you may want to check it out in the Asset Store first.

In the project management interface, select Resource Store to browse currently available resources.

> Currently, you can only choose to download reference packages, which means you can use the resources directly and the resources take up less space. However, you cannot make further edits to the resources themselves.
>
> However, once the asset is added to the scene, the instance can be edited to a certain extent, such as size, rotation, and scaling.

After the download is complete, select Import to import the resource into the specified project that has been created:
