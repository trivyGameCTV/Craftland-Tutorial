# AI Zombie

Technically speaking, AI refers to the AI entity component, which can be mounted on supported entities.

Currently, the AI component is only mounted on the zombie entity and cannot be customized to be mounted or not. Therefore, this article will mainly introduce how to configure and control zombies.

# Configure AI zombies

You can configure individual zombies through units, generate and configure zombies periodically through the zombie generator, or generate a set of zombie templates in batches through the unit generator.

For both Generators and Zombies, they can configure the properties of the zombies. And for Generators, there are some additional configurations on how to generate zombies.

## **Unit Zombie Configuration**

**HP**: The health of the AI zombie.

**Damage**: basic attack damage. Skill damage is calculated separately and is not affected by this configuration.

**Enemy scan distance**: the basic range of AI zombies to detect enemies. If there is a bonus, it will be modified on this basic value.

**Speed**: basic movement speed. If there is a bonus, it will be modified on this basic value.

**Turn on/off loot drop**: Whether to drop loot after being killed. The type of loot drop cannot be configured.

**Damage Ratio**: The percentage of damage received, ranging from 10 to 10000, with 10 being the lowest, meaning that only 10% of the original damage is received when taking damage.

**Type**: The type of zombie.

**Auto Scan Enemies**: Whether to automatically detect enemies within the enemy detection range.

**Faction**: The faction of the zombie.

**Attack type**: Active attack: actively attacks detected enemies. Passive attack: attacks enemies only when attacked. No attack: will not attack.

> For zombies with skills, they do not necessarily strictly adhere to the enemy detection and attack configuration, and may always attack the enemy with their skills.
>
> BOSS types of zombies all come with their own skills: such as the butcher, Mr. V, and the samurai.

**Path**: the default movement route, used in conjunction with path points.

Use the path point object to set the path of travel in the Scene:

After setting the path, you can select the corresponding path in the AI zombie configuration.

## **Zombie generator-specific configuration**

**Zombies per wave**: the number of zombies generated each time.

**# of waves**: when generating is not continuous, how many waves of zombies are generated per round.

**Continuous**: Zombies will be generated continuously, regardless of the number of waves set.

**Start time**: The number of seconds after the start of the round that the first wave of zombies will be generated.

**Wave interval**: The number of seconds between each wave of zombies.

> Zombies generated by the spawner will be destroyed at the start of the next round and will not drop any items.

## Unit spawner configuration

**# of units per wave**: How many units of the configured unit will be generated per wave.

**# of waves**: the total number of waves to generate.

**Template**: select a unit template from the scene to generate. Mutually exclusive with Prefab.

**Start time**: how long after the game starts to generate the first wave of units, in seconds.

**Continuous**: if checked, regardless of the wave configuration, continue to generate units in each wave.

**Wave interval**: the interval between each two waves of generated units, in seconds.

**Template (Prefab)**: Select the unit to be generated from the Prefab. Mutually exclusive with Template.

# Controlling AI Zombies via Blocks

After the AI Zombie or its generator is statically configured in the Scene, it can also be controlled during the game process via a script.

This mainly introduces the block script. The code script can use the corresponding API and events of the block script to perform the same operation.

## Generator operations

is not limited to AI zombies. The Generator API and events can be used to operate on all generators.

> Using this combination, you can obtain the unit entity generated by the generator each wave

## AI Zombie Operation

In addition to AI entities, zombies are also combat entities, targetable entities, entities, etc.

You can monitor the corresponding behavior of AI zombies using the corresponding events, and use the API to control the actions of AI zombies.

> Events for AI entities

## Example

A simple example of how to control an AI zombie using a block script.

The requirement is that the zombie should dodge whenever the player aims at it.

![image-20240805180544337](https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/17-AI/image-20240805180544337.png)

Attach this script to the zombie entity.

![image-20240805180604321](https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/17-AI/image-20240805180604321.png)

This will cause the zombie to move randomly in the horizontal direction when targeted.
