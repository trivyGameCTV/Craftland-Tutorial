# Annihilation Mode

**Annihilation Mode** is a classic elimination-based combat template in the Craftland Editor. Players are divided into two or more teams and engage in combat on a designated map. In each match, **players who are defeated cannot be revived** until only one team remains or time runs out.

This mode emphasizes **teamwork, positioning strategy, and equipment selection**, making it ideal for designing

fast-paced, tactical team competition maps.
