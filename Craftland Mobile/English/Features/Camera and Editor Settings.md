# Basic Editor Settings

The **Basic Editor Settings** button can be found in the upper left corner of the screen. These settings are designed to make it easier to use Craftland’s map editor and do not affect any other game mode.

# Camera Settings

The camera is the player’s visual tool for viewing the map. In Craftland, camera adjustments only apply while editing maps — they do not affect gameplay.  

Craftland has two camera modes: **Free Camera** and **Third Person**.  
The default is **Free Camera**, and you can switch anytime using the left-side buttons.  

---

## Third Person View

- The character appears at the center of the screen and can be controlled.  
- Use the **joystick** to move the character and **swipe** to move the camera.  

This allows testing of collision, climbing, and other interactive logic.

The right-hand controller adjusts the standing plane height of the character and the default object placement height.  
Example: set to 2 → both the character and objects appear at height 2.

## Free Camera

The camera is no longer bound to the character, allowing full vertical freedom.  
In addition to normal movement (forward/back/left/right), you can change altitude with the right-hand slider.

## Aerial & Rotate

Within Free Camera, there are:  

- **Aerial View:** switches quickly to a top-down view of the entire map.  
- **Rotate View:** available only in Aerial Mode. Each click rotates the camera 90°.

You can also adjust **Free Camera speed** in 【Settings → Camera Speed】:

- Low speed → precise placement and fine adjustments  
- High speed → convenient for navigating large maps quickly
