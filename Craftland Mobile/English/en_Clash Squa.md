# Clash Squard

Clash Squard mode is a high-intensity, round-based tactical combat game designed based on traditional CS match mechanics. In this mode, players are divided into two opposing teams and engage in multiple rounds of combat on the map. Players who are defeated in a round cannot be revived until that round ends.At the end of the round, all players will receive money rewards based on the number of kills in that round, which can be used to purchase weapons and consumables from the shop before the next round begins. Through continuous kills, reasonable equipment allocation, and teamwork, one side will win the majority of the rounds in the set number of rounds to win the entire match.

This mode combines three core elements—elimination mechanics, an economic system, and tactical operations—making it the gameplay template in the Craftland Editor that most closely resembles traditional tactical shooter experiences.
