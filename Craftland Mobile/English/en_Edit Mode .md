# Adjust Camera

The camera acts as the player's eyes in the game. 

Let’s fine-tune it to give you the perfect view!

## Free Camera

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/001.jpg" alt="001" style="zoom:40%;" />

On the left side of the screen, you’ll find a toggle for Free Camera/Third Person. By default, Craftland uses the Free Camera mode.

Here’s what you can do in this mode:

## Free Camera - Moving and Lifting

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/002.jpg" alt="002" style="zoom:40%;" />

> Move horizontally: Use the virtual joystick on the lower-left corner of the screen to move the camera horizontally without changing its height.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/003.jpg" alt="003" style="zoom:40%;" />

> Adjust speed: You can tweak the camera’s horizontal movement speed in "Settings - BASIC SETTINGS."

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/004.jpg" alt="004" style="zoom:40%;" />

> Move vertically: Use the slider on the right side of the screen to adjust the camera’s height without changing its horizontal position.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/005.jpg" alt="005" style="zoom:40%;" />

> Rotate freely: Drag anywhere else on the screen to rotate the camera while keeping its position fixed.

## Free Camera - Bird's-eye View

Expand the Free Camera options by clicking the arrow next to the button. You’ll see two options: Aerial and Rotate.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/006.jpg" alt="006" style="zoom:40%;" />

Aerial Mode: Click this to switch to a vertical, top-down view:

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/007.jpg" alt="007" style="zoom:40%;" />

In this mode, you can only see the top of objects, and cannot rotate the camera by swiping the screen.<br><br><br>

Clicking "Rotate" button under Aerial mode will rotate the map by 90 degree:

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/008.jpg" alt="008" style="zoom:40%;" />

Clicking "Rotate" button under non-Aerial mode will cause the camera to snap to the closest direction amongst "East, West, South, North".

## Third Person

Switch to Third Person by clicking the Free Camera button:

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/009_c.jpg" alt="009_c" style="zoom:40%;" />

In third-person perspective, you can control your character to move freely and observe your map like in a Free Fire game.

# Aim and Tap

Craftland offers two ways to select objects, like having two hands: Select Mode and Classic Mode.

## Tap Mode

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/010.jpg" alt="010" style="zoom:40%;" />

As shown in the picture, this option can be found under "Setting - BASIC SETTINGS".

Craftland uses "Select Mode" by default.

In this mode, click to select an object to operate.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/011.jpg" alt="011" style="zoom:40%;" />

While in "Free Camera" and "Select Mode", you can pinch the screen to zoom in or out.

## Classic Mode

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/012.jpg" alt="012" style="zoom:40%;" />

In "Classic" mode, there is a crosshair in the middle of the screen.<br><br><br>

Drag the screen to rotate the camera, aim the crosshair at an object, the object will be selected automatically:

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/013.jpg" alt="013" style="zoom:40%;" />

You cannot pinch zoom under Classic mode.

# Align Easily

These tools make aligning objects simple and save you the hassle of making detailed adjustments. Think of them as your ruler!

## Grid Settings

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/014.jpg" alt="014" style="zoom:40%;" />

The Grid feature is turned on by default and can be found under "Settings - BASIC SETTINGS."

This function is turned on by default.<br><br><br>

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/015.jpg" alt="015" style="zoom:40%;" />

Use the Mesh Granularity Settings to adjust the grid size, ranging from 1 meter to 0.1 meters.<br><br><br>

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/016.jpg" alt="016" style="zoom:40%;" />

Larger grids make alignment easier, while smaller grids allow for finer adjustments.

## Floating Plane

Grid only aligns four directions: front, back, left, and right.

Up and down alignment is implemented by floating plane.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/017.jpg" alt="017" style="zoom:40%;" />

Normally, objects are placed on the ground by default. 

To make objects float or align them at a specific height, you’ll need to use the Move panel manually.<br><br><br>

The Floating Plane acts as a temporary "ground" at a custom height, making vertical alignment much easier.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/018.jpg" alt="018" style="zoom:40%;" />

The default height of floating plane is 0, where it overlaps with the ground and has no effect.

Use the upward arrow to raise the floating plane by 1 meter at a time. 

The height is displayed in the middle of the arrows;

e.g. the height of the floating plane in the image above is 8 meters.<br><br><br>

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/019.jpg" alt="019" style="zoom:40%;" />

Once set, you can place objects directly on the floating plane.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/020.jpg" alt="020" style="zoom:40%;" />

Floating plane can be used to align the height of objects at ease.

Floating plane is just an auxiliary element and has no effect on the gameplay;

Feel free to use it.

## Camera Shifting

Switching between Free Camera and Third Person may cause the camera’s position to shift slightly.<br><br><br>

From "Free Camera" to "Third Person":

It makes your character lands slightly in front of your camera position, as shown below.

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/009.jpg" alt="009" style="zoom:40%;" />

Keep an eye if there are complex terrain below the camera.<br><br><br>

From "Third Person" to "Free Camera":

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/004_EditModeSettings/021.jpg" alt="021" style="zoom:40%;" />

The character disappears immediately, and the camera holds its position.

i.e. The height slider on the right will reappear and set to zero.
