# Defense Master

**Defense Master** is a PvPvE mode template centered around the core gameplay of “survival defense.” Players will face wave after wave of enemies that continuously respawn within a limited timeframe. By coordinating teamwork and defense strategies, players must either eliminate all enemies or survive until the end to secure victory.

# **Mode Rules**

Players are born in a designated defense area, and it is recommended that players be given a certain amount of weapons/resources at the beginning.

Victory conditions can be selected by default:

- **Survive until time runs out**;
- **Defeat a set number of zombie targets**;

Upon completing the victory conditions, players will win.
