# Resource Shop

The Resource Shop provides you with more personalized items to help you customize your personal item library.

Click the "Resource Shop" button at the top left of the screen to enter the following UI:

Here, you can download various items from other players.

As the resource shop grows, it will offer more and more types of "shop items."

Clicking the plus sign means you have ‘purchased’ this ‘shop item,’ and the item will be automatically downloaded.

> In the current phase, all items in the resource shop are free! You can purchase as many as you like, but be careful not to use up your memory.

# Manage your assets

## Add assets

Return to the resource shop and click the plus sign below the asset to add it to "My Assets."

After adding assets, they will be downloaded to your object panel and can be used freely.

The related assets have been removed from the category.

You can also click the check mark below the asset to remove individual assets.

If you want to use them again, you can add them back from the resource shop at any time.

There is also a "My Template Resources" category.

You can add combined objects to this category.

For example, select AI-generated objects, which are combined by default.

Slide to the bottom of the "Properties" panel and click "Save as My Template Resource."

In this way, the combined object is added to this category and can be used as desired.

(It can even be used in other maps!)
