# Spawn Point

<img src="https://dl.dir.freefiremobile.com/common/OB46/CSH/OfficialWeb/CLtutorial/005_Objects/001.jpg" alt="001" style="zoom:40%;" />

Spawn Point is so important that it is placed first in the sidebar.

There needs to be more spawn points than the amount of teams in order to start the game.

Otherwise, an error of "Insufficient spawn points" will show up (this error is commonly seen in Nexterra and Bermuda).

Origin Land and Isle of Champs come with two spawn points, so this error does not occur.

Last one is "Sound entity".

"3D sound effect" indicates whether the sound reduces with distance .

Gunshots should have 3D sound effect turned on, while background music should have 3D sound effect turned off.
