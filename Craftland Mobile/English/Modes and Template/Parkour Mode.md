# Parkour Mode

Parkour Mode is a game template in CL Editor specifically designed for jumping, obstacle courses, route challenges, and reaction-based gameplay. In this mode, players control a character using actions such as jumping, dodging, and sprinting to navigate through various obstacle terrains designed by creators, with the goal of reaching the finish line or completing the route in the shortest possible time.

This mode emphasizes platform control, physics-based movement, and map structure design, making it one of the best options for creating “challenging yet fun” maps.
# **Rules**
 In Parkour Mode, players must navigate through complex obstacles to reach checkpoints. In team competitions, the team whose all members reach the finish line first wins.In single-player mode, the first player to reach the finish line wins.

Checkpoints and the finish line must be included in Parkour mode for the game to function properly.The finish line is the objective of Parkour mode; players win by reaching the finish line. 
Checkpoints are automatically numbered in the order they are placed. Players must pass through checkpoints in sequence (starting from 1) and reach the finish line to complete the game. # **Common Objects in This Mode**
To enable creators to design diverse levels flexibly, the Parkour mode recommends using the following components:

- Rubber: Pushes players upward, typically used to connect multi-level platforms.
- Gravity Change Zones: Increases jump height and climbing speed in specific areas.
- Trap Mechanisms (e.g., propellers, moving platforms, giant hammer mechanisms, ring mechanisms, foldable walls, frying pan mechanisms, block mechanisms): Used to create dynamic parkour puzzles.- Teleportation gates: Used to switch between different areas and create secret passages. 
- Modular components: The editor provides various components that can be placed along paths to create diverse obstacles and challenging routes.
