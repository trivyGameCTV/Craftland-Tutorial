# Hide and Seek

Hide and Seek mode is a popular entertainment template in CL Editor. In this mode, players are divided into two teams: the hiders (who transform into scene props) and the seekers (who defeat the hiders). Through camouflage techniques and tactical cooperation, each team must complete their respective objectives to win the game.
