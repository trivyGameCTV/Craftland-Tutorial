# Gun Master

Gun Master is a competitive game mode template designed specifically for “advanced weapons” in the CL Editor. It features a complete weapon upgrade system: players continuously upgrade their weapons by defeating enemies in the game until they complete all phases of kills. The first player or team to complete all weapon kills wins.
